# 🚗 Power BI Car Sales Dashboard

## 📖 Overview
This Power BI project visualizes **car sales performance across multiple years (2019–2022)** for three different car models.  
Each model is represented as a separate dashboard view, allowing users to explore yearly performance differences and understand key business metrics like **sales, pre-bookings, growth**, and **profit trends**.

The core idea behind this project was to analyze **how sales vary by car model and year**, providing clear insights into which models performed better and during which months or years.
